# Connect-Four-Game
A C# project that mimics the real-life Connect-Four game that I finalized back in 12th grade for my certificate work.

Although this game is entirely in Romanian, the game rules included, I figured I would include a documentation in English which explains the implementation process thoroughly, should you want to read more about that.
